# Part 1

## Problem

Take a list of numbers from a file (one per line) and count the occasions where a number is greater than the one before it.

## General solution

Read in each line and store in a variable length array (or similar structure, depending on the language). Iterate over the array and count all instances where a[index] > a[index - 1], excluding index == 0.

Alternatively, read in each line and keep a record of the previous line to compare with. This would involve less code and less memory, since building an array of lines means effectively loading the entire file into memory. This is probably not an optimisation worth making for a problem with limited input, but may be necessary if the file was particularly large (e.g. several hundred megabytes).

## Solution: Go

Scan the input (`os.Stdin`) and add each line to a slice (Go's equivalent to a variable length array in PHP). Iterate over the slice with `for` and print the final count.

```go
package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"strconv"
)

func main() {
	scanner := bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)
	increasedMeasurements := 0
	var input []int

	for scanner.Scan() {
		number, _ := strconv.Atoi(scanner.Text())
		input = append(input, number)
	}

	for i := range input {
		if i > 0 && input[i] > input[i-1] {
			increasedMeasurements++
		}
	}

	fmt.Println(increasedMeasurements)
}
```
