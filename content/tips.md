Advent of Code problems can seem daunting at first, especially if you're using a new language to solve them. They also get progressively harder as the month goes on.

## Use the test input

The test input provided each day is a great way to quickly test whether you are on the right lines. It won't tell you if your solution is optimised - your individual puzzle input is usually substantially larger than the test input - but you will get an indication of whether your algorithms are correct.

I used to jump straight to trying to solve the problem for my individual input, and I often came unstuck. Problems became much easier once I started from the test input, and in most cases the code would work with my individual input without any changes.
